## Why

Sorting examples are really good education tools.
Not because you are actually going to use them in production. In fact, none of this should be used in actual production code.

`O(n2)` should not be used with large datasets.
Your best bet for large datasets would be `O(n log n)`

Or `O(n)` :p

Run them `yarn run test`
